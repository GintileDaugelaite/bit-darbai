        <p> The enfant terrible of classical music, French pianist Sofiane Pamart has announced the release of his
            second studio album, LETTER, out February 11 on Play It Again Sam, sharing lead single ‘LOVE.’ One of 2021’s
            top 10 most-streamed classical artists in the world, Pamart has built a career on defying elitist rules,
            imbuing his brooding, poetic and emotionally poignant classical compositions with flickers of hip-hop
            influence, opening the oft-cloistered genre up to a much wider audience. Steadfastly devoted to his own work
            as opposed to the interpretation of classical repertoire, the forthcoming LETTER aims to prove why the
            boundary-pushing, ground-breaking Pamart is worthy of his dazzling success.

                Romantic and delicate, new single ‘LOVE’ illustrates the distance in love: referring, with a sweet
                melancholy, to the symbolic distance of detachment as well as the physical aspect of absence.
