                Romantic and delicate, new single ‘LOVE’ illustrates the distance in love: referring, with a sweet
                melancholy, to the symbolic distance of detachment as well as the physical aspect of absence.The
                presence of birds in the video represents the volatile and evolutive dimensions of love. Whether it
                is through passion, an alliance, friendship, fear or affection, love always spreads, it’s ephemeral,
                fatal and ever-changing. The music video is once more directed by the secretive duo Sofiane Pamart and
                Guillaume Héritier with whom he just co-wrote the book PLANÈTE, their travel and poetry notebook.
