            <p class="greeting"> Dear Jason,</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020.
                </p>
                <p>I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I’m tendering
                    my
                    resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.</p>
                <p>I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a
                    customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive,
                    inspiring team
                    of people to grow and learn with.</p>
                <p>I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your
                    support
                    has meant so much to me.</p>
                <p>Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="ending">
            <p class="bye">Thanks, and best wishes,</p>
